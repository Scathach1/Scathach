This is a site project for my HTML class.
This site is to act as a history site to 
preserve current documents and accounts. 
Users can futher contribute to history 
through the Journal section of the site, 
where they can write their accounts of an event.
This site can allow users to acess just about anything
from the Ulster Cycle to the United States Constitution,
avaliable for online reading or download.
THIS IS ONLY A HYPOTETICAL SITE, THIS IS ONLY A SCHOOL PROJECT.
